                  He is a disciplined sportsman who never gives up and tries his best till the end. Cricket is his passion, and he worked hard to achieve success in it. No matter what others say about his current form, he will always be my favourite sportsman.            </p>

                Yeah, somewhere in Europe. But if I’m playing cricket and I want to have some downtime, I think Australia is a great place. But if I want to be on a holiday where no one recognizes us, then I’m definitely somewhere in Europe or one of the Arctic countries, Arctic countries, you know, where there’s so much snow…               
                 <br> <br>
                 Oh, I can sit and not move from one place for hours. You know, that’s how lazy I can be as much energy as I show on the field. But when I get time at home, I can just be a total vegetable and you know, I can be very annoying because I don’t move at all.            </p>

                There are times when one gets lazy or is in a mood to relax, skipping daily routine. But Virat Kohli is different. His work ethics are most important for him, putting other stuff in the waiting list. He is always ready for practice, gym sessions and other day to day work required to keep him fit and in shape               
                 <br> <br>
                 One of his more popular quotes pushed athletes to give their best on the field no matter what. He believes that if they give everything they have, they won't be answerable to anyone. "If I work hard 120% every day of my life, I'm answerable to no one who doubted me," said Kohl            </p>
